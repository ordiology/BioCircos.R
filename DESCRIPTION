Description: Implement in 'R' interactive Circos-like visualizations of genomic data, to map information
	such as genetic variants, genomic fusions and aberrations to a circular genome, as proposed by the
	'JavaScript' library 'BioCircos.js', based on the 'JQuery' and 'D3' technologies. The output is by 
	default displayed in stand-alone HTML documents or in the 'RStudio' viewer pane. Moreover it can be
	integrated in 'R Markdown' documents and 'Shiny' applications.
